This project focuses on investigating 

1.Machine learning algorithms for extracting geospatial feature data from historical paper maps to generate mixed reality perspectives. 
2.Perform a comparitive analysis of the historical paper map data with high resolution open street map data or other topographical data sets secured from satelite imagery
3.the feasability of integrating extracted geospatial feature data from historical paper maps to existing spatial data infrastructure.
