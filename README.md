This project focuses on investigating 
-Machine learning algorithms for extracting geospatial feature data from historical paper maps to generate mixed reality perspectives. 
-Perform a comparitive analysis of the historical paper map data with high resolution open street map data or other topographical data sets secured from satelite imagery
-the feasability of integrating extracted geospatial feature data from historical paper maps to existing spatial data infrastructure.
